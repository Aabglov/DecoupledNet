# DecoupledNet
My testing and work with DNI (Decoupled Neural Interface) network

Note: the reference to these networks "having back-prop" or not is a bit of a misnomer.  DNI still uses back-prop, but in a different way than a traditional feed-foward net.  I mostly used this term because it gave the files amusing names.
